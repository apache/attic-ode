This package contains the RPC Protocol Adapter.
This adapter is used to make PXE services that implement synchronous
WSDL operations (i.e. those following the request-response MEP) "look like"
blocking Java calls. The RPC adapter is necessary because PXE is rather
asynchronous and does not "block" while a request-response operation
is performed; hence there is an impedence mismatch of sorts when attempting
to integrate PXE into more traditional applications that expect web
service invocations to block.
