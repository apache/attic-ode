    <p>
    This package contains the PXE Service Provider API, i.e. the interfaces implemented
    and used by PXE Service Provider implementations.
    Each PXE Service Provider implementation is a "mini-container", capable of
    hosting specific types of <em>PXE Services</em> (e.g. a BPEL Service Provider
    can host BPEL processes).
    </p>
    <p>
    The most significant interface in this package is {@link com.fs.jlo.sfwk.spi.ServiceProvider}
    --it must be implemented by any PXE  Service Provider.
    This interface includes methods for managing the configuration of PXE Services within
    the provider and methods for handling events destined for the hosted services.
    </p>

    <p>
    Events destined for hosted services are of two flavors: <em>message-exchange events</em>,
    and <em>scheduled work events</em>. 
This package contains implementations of the message-exchange event objects.
Message-exchange event objects are asynchronously delivered to the service provider implementation
to communicate the status of inter-service communications.
These inter-service communication correspond to invocations on WSDL <em>operations</em>
(starting with WSDL 1.2, "operations" are referred to as "message exchanges").
For example, if a request ("input") message is received on a service's in-port, an
<code>InputRcvdMessageExchangeEvent</code> is delivered.
<p/>
In addition to event implementations indicating the arrival of request ("input") and response ("output")
messages, event implementations are also provided for WSDL 1.2 concepts such as input faults:
at the present time, these WSDL 1.2 events are not used.
