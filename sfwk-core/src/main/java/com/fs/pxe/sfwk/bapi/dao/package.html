    <p>Interfaces defining the PXE container's Data Access Objects (DAO)s--
    can be used to implement a persistence layer for PXE. 
    
    The <code>com.fs.jlo.sfwk.bapi.dao</code> package consists of
    data access interfaces used by the PXE container. These interfaces
    encapsulate the persistent storage required to reliably maintain
    deployment state as well as the conversational state of each
    deployed system (i.e. message exchanges between the services
    in the system).</p>
    
    <p>The model provided by these interfaces does not provide
    state management that may be necessary for any particular
    provider. For example, the BPEL Service Provider must provide
    its own data access layer for keeping track of the state of
    each process instance.</p>

    <p>Like all data access objects (&quot;DAOs&quot;) in the
    PXE distribution, the framework DAO is a ?dumb?
    object-relational model (i.e. the data access model
    mechanically implements an ER schema, is only aware of
    DAO and simple data types, and does not contain any
    business logic) that can be easily implemented using JDO,
    EJBs, JDBC, or through an XML database. Also, like all
    other DAOs, the framework DAO must be transaction aware;
    that is, the objects are used only in the presence of a
    transaction, and a rollback on that transaction must be
    respected by the data model.</p>
    
    <p>A JDO-based framework DAO is provided.</p>
