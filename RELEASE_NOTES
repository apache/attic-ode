Apache ODE Release Notes
========================

Apache 2.0-beta is an early release of an improved version of the
ODE runtime, supporting better performance and reliability.
 
Apache ODE 2.0-beta requires Java 1.5.x. The WAR distribution can run 
in most J2EE servlet container. The JBI distribution should be able to
run in any JBI container but has only been tested with ServiceMix
3.1 so far. See the BUILDING file if you want to build your own
distribution from the source release.
