    <p>SOAP Messaging Service Provider permits integration of the
    ODE framework with external SOAP-based communication transports.
    The provider is symmetric and provides both client and server
    functionality. The essential function of this component is to
    act as a bridge between external SOAP carrier protocols such as
    HTTP and internal ODE channels.  This provider is capable of
    processing any SOAP message conforming to WS-I Basic Profile v1.0,
    and supports the detection of various hazard conditions that may
    occur in the presence of timeouts and non-transacted transport
    protocols.</p>
