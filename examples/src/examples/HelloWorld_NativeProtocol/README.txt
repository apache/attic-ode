This example demonstrates the use of the "native" protocol adapter.  This allows
sending/receiving WSDL message parts directly as xml strings, rather than through
another protocol e.g. SOAP.  Connecting to the service provider for sending and
receiving data is done via the PXE resource adapter (PxeConnectionFactory).  See
the "HelloWorldNativeClient.java" for more detail.
