This example demonstrates the use of the Process/Instance Management interfaces.

The relevant source code is in the "java" directory. 

To run the example run the 'list' ANT targets. This will produce a list a processes
and instances meeting the default criteria (built to match the HelloWorld example).
To modify the selection criteria, update the query filters in the BpelManagementExample
class in the "java" directory.
