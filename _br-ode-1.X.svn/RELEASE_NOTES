Apache ODE Release Notes
========================

Apache ODE 1.3 includes both a few new features and many bug fixes. 
It's also the most stable version of ODE released so far.

Apache ODE 1.1.1 requires Java 1.5.x. The WAR distribution can run in
most J2EE servlet container. The JBI distribution should be able to
run in any JBI container but has only been tested with ServiceMix
3.1 so far. See the BUILDING file if you want to build your own
distribution from the source release.
