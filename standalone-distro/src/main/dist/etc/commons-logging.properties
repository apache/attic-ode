# Commons-Logging Properties. Used by all PXE executables to set
# up the logging framework. By default this is Log4J, but it 
# can be changed to anything that has a commons-logging factory or
# logger implementation. 
#
# NOTE: If Log4J is not used, standard verbosity command-line 
#       arguments -v -vv will not work. 

# Comment the following if you do not want Log4J Logging
org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4jFactory

# Uncomment the following (and comment the above) for Jdk 1.4 logging
#org.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger
